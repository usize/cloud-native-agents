Dynamic Agent Discovery
=======================

Agent cards make it possible to search through catalogs of agents, with locators
to lead you to resources like source code, docker containers or endpoints.

One use case of such cards is to allow for agents to be discoverd and composed
offline, then assembled into a running system. Like containers being composed.

Another interesting use case is allowing for the run time discovery of new agents
in order to satisfy requests beyond the capabilities of the initial system.

This could prove useful in the context of an organization, where agents might
act on behalf of teams and employees.
